# Software products are like babies

One lesson I've learnt so far working in a e-commerce outfit ...

Software products are like babies - they have to be brought up enough attention while in nursery lest
they grow up to become monstrosities you cannot recognise - worse still, you will be held at ransom 
to give in every whim and fancy because you can't back out from SLA with clients.

One can find plenty of good advice like this, <https://goinnn.github.io/zen-of-high-load-and-high-availability-backend/index.html>
But you only have the luxury of practicing good hygiene while your product is in nursery.

In other words, while developing proof-of-concept (POC) and prototypes, you must keep a complete record of 
makeshift compromises and shortcuts for the sake of expediency. 
They must be redone properly before the POC graduate to production use.
