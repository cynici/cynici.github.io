# Show Chrome on all workspaces or just one

It took me awhile to figure out how to make Chrome window appear in every workspace (virtual desktop in Windows parlance) or just one, on Ubuntu Desktop.

1. In Chrome window, Settings
1. Go to Appearance
2. Enable "Use system title bar and border"

Once you've enabled it, you will be able to right-click on the Chrome title bar and toggle "Always on Visible Workspace".
